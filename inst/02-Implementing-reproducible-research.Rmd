# Implementing reproducible research
  
## Overview

Four factors have lead to growing concerns about the reproducibility of scientific results in modern science. The first factor is reruns of landmark biomedical experiments that have failed to produce the same results as the initial publication of the experiment [@Prinz2011drugtargets; @Begley2012clinical]. The second factor is the discovery of high-profile studies where the published results were flawed due to simple errors data analysis[@baggerly2009deriving; @Herndon2013austerity]. Third, there has been a sharp rise in the number of scholarly publications that have been retracted due to discoveries of misconduct such as fraudulent data and plagiarism [@Vannoorden2011retractions; @Steen2013retractions]. Finally, there has been a growth of data-intensive research that use massive computer simulations or collect enourmous amounts of data from vast numbers of sensors (ie. astronomy and oceanography). These events have stimulated extensive discussion in many disciplines about how to improve the reproducibility of scientific research. Some of this discussion has resulted in calls from diverse dsicplines [@nosek2015open] for publications to be accompanied by both the raw data that generated the figures in the paper [@reichman2011challenges], and the programming code that shows the steps taken in the data analysis [@barnes2010publish; @Ince1012opencomputer; @Morin2012blackbox]. Related to these calls are a manifesto-like journal articles by groups of researchers that call for substantial changes in the research workflow to improve reproducibilty and transparency [@wilson2014best; @Hampton2015tao; @Sandve2013tenrules].

In this chapter I show how archaeologists can respond to these calls for increased reproducibilty and transparency. I sketch out how R can be used to enable reproducible research through literate programming. Literate programming refers to the use of a computing environment for authoring mixed natural (eg. English) and computer (eg. R) language documents [@Schulte2012literate]. Conventiently, R and RStudio are well-equipped to support literate programming, so the practice is relatively easy to learn. The second section of this chapter introduces version control as a principle and tool for enhancing transparency and collaboration. Version control of literate programming files allows you to keep track of all the changes that you and your co-authors make to your files. Using the Git software for version control, you and your collaborators can safely create versions of your files to experiment with, and either abandon the results, merge them with the main versions, or revert to an earlier version.

## What does it mean to do reproducible research?

Before showing how we can make our research more reproucible, we should explore exactly what we mean by 'reproducible'. There is some confusion surrounding recent use of the term 'reproducibility' in biology and computer science. The confusion results from using the term at two quite different parts of the research pipeline.

The first part is empirical reproducibility, also called 'replicability'. For an archaeologist, this means evaluating a previously obtained result by re-excavating a site that another researcher had previously excavated, studying a museum collection that had previously been analysed by another person, or repeating an experiement that has been previously published. Empirical reproducibility is about returning to the source of the data and physically collecting the data again. Archaeologists do this routinely, for example, we return to famous sites such as Star Carr, Catal Huyuk, and Niah Cave to excavate them again. Usually this happens decades after the original excavation that make the site prominent. This is not exact empirical reproducibility, because we do not use the exact procedures of the previous workers, but instead use modern field methods to extract more data from the site, and improve upon and extend the earlier work. But the general idea of testing the previous claims about the site is usually the key motivation for returning to it. 

The second use of 'reproducibility' is computational and statistical reproducibility. This refers to redoing the calculations of another researcher's quantitative results using their original datasets and methods. This type of reproducibility does not involve independent data collection, but instead uses the methods and data collected by the original investigator. This kind of reproducibilty is not something that is familiar to most archaeologists. Our publications rarely include enough of the data to enable reanalysis, and our methods are rarely presented in enough detail to allow another person to independantly repeat our analysis unabimguously. This type of reproducibility is becoming an important issue for recent archaeological research due to advances in technology and the rapid spread of computational methods for many kinds of basic archaeological analysis. In my view, the short answer to improving  computational and statistical reproducibility in archaeology is for archaeologists to include data files and programming code with their publications. These extra documents will allow another researcher to see all the steps from when the raw data entered the researcher's computer to the end point where these data were summarised and visualised in a journal article. 

In this chapter I describe two principles, literate programming and version control. These are dervied from computer science research and have been adopted by other disciplines, such as ecology and political science, to enable computational and statistical reproducibility. I also demonstrate the current software tools (Rmarkdown, knitr, and Git) that allow us to put these principles into practice. Over time, these software tools will change, and perhaps be replaced by something completely different. However, the principles that they are based on will endure, and are worth becoming familiar with as key concepts in computational and statistical reproducibility.
