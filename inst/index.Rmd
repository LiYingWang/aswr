# Archaeological Science with R

This book will teach you how to get started doing archaeological science with R: You'll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for archaeological science.  

To be published by XXX in XXX 201X.

Here is a summary of the progress of the book:

```{r writing-progress, echo = FALSE}

library(wordcountaddin)
library(purrr)
library(tibble)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(readr)

# get chapter names and last edit dates of the chapters in inst/
the_chapters <- dir(pattern = "^[0-9]{2}.*Rmd$")
last_edit <- 
  map_df(the_chapters, ~file.info(.x)) %>% 
  select(mtime) %>% 
  rename(last_edit = mtime)

# get word counts of the chapters
the_word_counts_of_the_chapters <- 
  map(the_chapters, 
      ~wordcountaddin:::text_stats_fn_(readLines(.x))) %>% 
  map_int(., ~.x$n_words_stri) %>% 
  data_frame(chapter = the_chapters,
             Wordcount = .) %>% 
  separate(chapter, 
           c("Number", "Title"), 
             sep = "(?<=[0-9]{2})\\-(?=[A-Z]+)") %>% 
  mutate(Title = trimws(gsub("-|.Rmd", " ", Title))) %>% 
  bind_cols(last_edit) 

# writing log, idea from https://github.com/Robinlovelace/geocompr/blob/5076612a8913165083cfd62610d01c0b38c061d7/README.Rmd

# initial log:
# write.csv(the_word_counts_of_the_chapters, "book_stats.csv", row.names = FALSE)
# subsequent updating
book_stats <- read_csv("book_stats.csv")
# add new rows of current session stats
book_stats_updated <- 
  bind_rows(book_stats, 
            the_word_counts_of_the_chapters)
# write to file
write.csv(book_stats_updated, 
          "book_stats.csv", 
          row.names = FALSE)
  
# show the table of current word counts
kable(the_word_counts_of_the_chapters)

# show plot of progress
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(book_stats_updated,
       aes(last_edit,
           Wordcount,
           colour = paste0(Number, "_", Title))) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_colour_discrete("Chapter")



```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
### Notes to self

# - To render the book to PDF and HTML (since it's [nested in a project directory](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues/215)), 
# rmarkdown::render_site("inst/.", output_format = 'bookdown::gitbook', encoding = 'UTF-8')
# setwd and then bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::gitbook")
# setwd and then `source('_render.R')` or 
# Rscript -e "bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::gitbook')" or 

# - To get a [live preview of the book in HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/serve-the-book.html): setwd and then `bookdown::serve_book(dir = ".", output_dir = "_book", preview = TRUE, in_session = TRUE, daemon = FALSE)`
```

<!---
# TODO
- rexcel and jailbreakr: how to get a dataframe out of that?
- where to put list and data frame indexing? ch4 prep
- where to put regex? ch4 prep
